# Firefly

## Context

This is an experiment on using three.js for a little (silly) storytelling. The original code was written when working with [Edouard Reinach](https://twitter.com/ereinach) for the homepage of Hypractif, which I slightly modified so it can stand on its own as a demo.

This was my first encounter with WebGL, so it can be a good learning resource on achieving interesting results with WebGL without too much technical knowledge.

The mountains model was done by [Albert Zablit](https://twitter.com/albertzablit).

### Caveats

Reloading the page could pretty much murder your computer fans. This could be due to a version mismatch between the exported model and three.js. I don't have access to the original model, so dead fans it is ... sorry.
